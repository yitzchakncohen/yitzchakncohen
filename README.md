I am a Unity developer with four years of experience developing in the Unity game engine and coding in C#, looking for a full-time position. I specialize in gameplay programming and debugging with a strong focus on Object-oriented programming. I bring to the table strong problem solving and critical thinking from my engineering degree and experience. I also have a broad skillset and enjoy learning new technologies and applying them in my work. As a lifelong learner, I am continuing my part time computer science degree, as well as constantly taking courses to learn more about Unity and Unreal.
